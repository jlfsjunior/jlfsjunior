Hello world!

I am JosÃ© and I am currently working at [In Commodities](https://incommodities.com/#about) as a Data Scientist for Power Trading. Prior to that, I have worked for around 3 years in two other Danish companies in a similar role.

My academic background is in Theoretical/Computational Physics and I have completed my doctorate studies in [Grenoble Alpes University](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [Institut NÃ©el](neel.cnrs.fr) in Grenoble, France.

My career interests circle around the usage of statistics and algorithms to understand complex behavior through data and optimization problems in general. My primary language is Python, however I have also experience working with R in recent years and Fortran in an (almost) forgotten past. 

I am also very interested in how to communicate with data, primarily through web applications and interactive charts. This led me to play around with Javascript, React, D3 and other web technologies. In my professional setting, I have mainly worked with "Data Science friendly" web frameworks such as Dash (for Python) and Shiny (for R) and I have developed and maintained several web applications in my past employer, [The LEGO Group](lego.com).

Now, following Github's suggestions:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about financial markets and how to model options.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Dash Chakra UI Components](https://dash-chakraui-components.herokuapp.com/) (pleeeease ðŸ˜ƒ)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: RStudio Connect before I forget about it; D3, because I don't want to forget about it
