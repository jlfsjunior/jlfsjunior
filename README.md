Hello world!

I am Jos√© and I am currently working at [In Commodities](https://incommodities.com/#about) as a Data Scientist for Power Trading. Prior to that, I have worked for around 3 years in two other Danish companies in a similar role.

My academic background is in Theoretical/Computational Physics and I have completed my doctorate studies in [Grenoble Alpes University](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/)/[Institut N√©el](neel.cnrs.fr).

I am interested in how to use different technologies and skills to build data-intensive applications.

More to come...
